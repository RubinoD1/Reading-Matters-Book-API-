## About 

Reading Matters makes use of the Google Book API to search for books based on title, author, publisher, subject, or ISBN. Book information that is retrieved includes a book cover image, book title, author, description, categories, rating, publisher, publication date, and page count. 

The API calls retrive info for 40 search results, which is the max allowed search results for the Google Book API.
